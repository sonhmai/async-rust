# A multiproducer, multi-consumer channel that weâ€™ll use to implement our async
#queue, allowing tasks to be safely passed around within the runtime. We could
#use async-channel here but are opting for flume because we want to be able
#to clone receivers, as we are going to be distributing tasks among consumers.
#Additionally, flume provides unbounded channels that can hold an unlimited
#number of messages and implements lock-free algorithms. This makes flume
#particularly beneficial for highly concurrent programs, where the queue might
#need to handle a large number of messages in parallel, unlike the standard library
#channels that rely on a blocking mutex for synchronization.
